## Docker Deployment

### Build and Run

```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t catc-mcp-server .

# Run with environment file
docker run -d --name catc-mcp-server \
  --env-file .env \
  -p 8002:8002 \
  catc-mcp-server
```

### Docker Compose

Add to your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  catc-mcp-server:
    build: ./catc-mcp-server
    container_name: catc-mcp-server
    env_file:
      - ./catc-mcp-server/.env
    environment:
      - MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0
      - MCP_PORT=8002
    ports:
      - "8002:8002"
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - default
```

**Or use the main project's deployment:**
```bash
# From project root  
./deploy.sh start catc          # Deploy only Catalyst Center server
./deploy.sh start cisco         # Deploy Cisco platforms (includes Catalyst Center)
./deploy.sh start management    # Deploy Meraki + Catalyst Center
./deploy.sh start all           # Deploy all servers including Catalyst Center
```

### Logs and Debugging

```bash
# View container logs
docker logs catc-mcp-server

# Enable debug logging
docker run -e LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG catc-mcp-server
```

### Startup behavior and MCP client connectivity

The server is designed so that **MCP clients (e.g. Cursor) can connect even when the container cannot reach Catalyst Center at startup** (e.g. different network, VPN not up yet):

- **Server always starts listening.** The HTTP MCP server binds to `MCP_HOST:MCP_PORT` (e.g. `0.0.0.0:8002`) and serves the `/mcp` endpoint regardless of whether startup authentication to Catalyst Center succeeds. This allows Cursor and other MCP clients to connect and discover tools immediately.
- **Startup auth is optional.** At startup the server attempts to authenticate with Catalyst Center (with a **15-second timeout** so startup does not hang). If that fails, a warning is logged and the server continues to start. Tool calls will attempt authentication when first used (and on 401 retries).
- **Why this matters.** If the server required successful auth before listening, it would exit or hang when run in Docker without reachability to Catalyst Center. Clients would never see the server in their MCP list. With the current behavior, the server is always listed once the container is running; tools return clear errors if Catalyst Center is still unreachable when you use them.

**For tools to work**, the host running the container (or the container network) must be able to reach `CATC_URL` when you invoke tools. Restart Cursor (or reload the window) after the container is up so it can connect to the server.

## Integration

### MCP Client Configuration

**Cursor IDE (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Catalyst-Center-MCP-Server": {
      "transport": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8002/mcp",
      "timeout": 60000
    }
  }
}
```

**LibreChat (`librechat.yaml`):**
```yaml
mcpServers:
  CatC-MCP-Server:
    type: streamable-http
    url: http://catc-mcp-server:8002/mcp
    timeout: 60000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Container Won't Start:**
```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker logs catc-mcp-server

# Common causes:
# 1. Missing CATC_URL, CATC_USERNAME, or CATC_PASSWORD in .env file
# 2. Port 8002 already in use (check: lsof -i :8002)
# 3. Invalid Catalyst Center URL format (must include https://)
# 4. Network connectivity issues to Catalyst Center
```

**Authentication Errors:**
```bash
# Test Catalyst Center authentication
curl -k -X POST "https://catalyst-center.example.com/api/system/v1/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"YOUR_USERNAME","password":"YOUR_PASSWORD"}'

# Expected response: JWT token
# Error responses: 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden
```

**Network Connectivity:**
```bash
# Test basic connectivity
ping catalyst-center.example.com
telnet catalyst-center.example.com 443

# Test from container (if needed)
docker exec catc-mcp-server ping catalyst-center.example.com
```

**MCP Client Connection Issues / server not in Cursor MCP list:**
- The server **starts listening even when startup auth to Catalyst Center fails** (see [Startup behavior and MCP client connectivity](#startup-behavior-and-mcp-client-connectivity)). If the container previously exited on auth failure, rebuild and restart so the updated behavior is in use; then the MCP server will listen on port 8002 and Cursor can connect.
- Restart Cursor (or reload the window) after the container is running so it rediscovers MCP servers.

```bash
# Verify MCP endpoint is accessible
curl http://localhost:8002/mcp

# Should return MCP protocol response
# If connection refused, check container status:
docker ps | grep catc-mcp-server
```

**SSL Certificate Issues:**
```bash
# Test SSL connectivity  
openssl s_client -connect catalyst-center.example.com:443

# For self-signed certificates in corporate environments,
# check container logs for SSL verification errors
```

**Permission Issues:**
- Verify user has appropriate RBAC permissions in Catalyst Center:
  - **Observer**: Minimum for read operations
  - **Operator**: For device management operations
  - **Administrator**: For full functionality
- Check if API access is enabled for the user account
- Ensure user account is not locked or disabled
- Verify user has access to the specific network sites/devices

### Performance Optimization

- **Pagination**: Use appropriate page sizes for large datasets
- **Filtering**: Apply filters to reduce data transfer and processing
- **Session Reuse**: Server automatically manages session tokens
- **Caching**: Results cached appropriately to reduce API calls

## Security Considerations

### Production Deployment

1. **Credential Security**: Store credentials in secure secrets management
2. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS and restrict network access
3. **Access Control**: Configure appropriate RBAC permissions
4. **Session Management**: Monitor and audit API session usage
5. **Certificate Management**: Use valid SSL certificates

### Best Practices

- **Credential Rotation**: Regularly rotate Catalyst Center passwords
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit logging
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate management network traffic
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enable MFA for Catalyst Center access

## Support

For issues and questions:

1. **Check Logs**: `docker logs catc-mcp-server`
2. **Verify Credentials**: Test with Catalyst Center API directly
3. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure access to Catalyst Center
4. **Permissions**: Verify user RBAC permissions
5. **API Status**: Check Catalyst Center API service status
